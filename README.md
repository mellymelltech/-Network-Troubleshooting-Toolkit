# 🌐 Network Troubleshooting Toolkit

A Python-based toolkit designed to automate common network troubleshooting tasks, such as ping tests, traceroutes, and bandwidth monitoring. This toolkit helps IT professionals quickly identify and resolve network issues, reducing downtime and improving efficiency.

## 🚀 Features

- **📡 Ping Tests**: Automatically ping multiple IP addresses or domain names to check network connectivity.
- **🛤️ Traceroute**: Performs traceroute operations to identify network paths and potential bottlenecks.
- **📶 Bandwidth Monitoring**: Measures network bandwidth usage and logs the data for analysis.
- **📊 Latency Reports**: Generates latency reports for ping and traceroute tests.
- **🔄 Scheduled Tasks**: Can be scheduled to run at regular intervals using cron jobs or task schedulers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **🐍 Python**: Core scripting language for automating network tasks.
- **📡 Scapy**: Python library used for packet manipulation and network tasks.
- **🌐 Subprocess Module**: Executes system commands like ping and traceroute.
- **📊 Matplotlib**: Optional for visualizing network performance data.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Admin or root access to execute network commands (e.g., ping, traceroute).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-toolkit.git
    cd network-toolkit
    ```

2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the toolkit with desired options:
    ```bash
    python3 network_toolkit.py --ping google.com --traceroute google.com --bandwidth
    ```

4. (Optional) Schedule the toolkit to run automatically using cron jobs:
    ```bash
    crontab -e
    # Run the toolkit every hour
    0 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/network_toolkit.py --ping google.com --traceroute google.com --bandwidth
    ```

### Example Troubleshooting Tasks

- **Ping Test**: Checks the connectivity and latency of a remote host.
- **Traceroute**: Identifies the network path to a remote host and potential slow hops.
- **Bandwidth Monitoring**: Measures current network throughput for analysis.
- **Latency Report**: Provides a report on average ping times and network stability.
